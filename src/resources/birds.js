        description: 'The great egret is a slender, graceful heron that forages in marshlands. During the breeding season it displays a spectacular cloak of delicate feathery plumes. It is the most widespread of all the herons in Belize. The great egret feeds in all the shallow waters of Belize. This large bird coils its sinewy neck, ready to spear prey. Prey includes fish, aquatic invertebrates and reptiles. During the drier months, the bird will stalk small mammals, snails and nesting birds.',

        description: 'Harpy Eagles are well known as one of the most powerful eagles in the Americas, hunting prey as large as monkeys and sloths for food.  Birds can weigh up to 20 pounds and have a 7-foot wingspan making them a formidable predator.  In Belize the population of the eagle declined as a result of forest fragmentation, shooting, and nest destruction, resulting in near extirpation of the species. However  projects like the Belize Harpy Eagle Restoration Project in collaboration with  Sharon Matola, Founder & Director of The Belize Zoo and The Peregrine Fund strives for re-establishment of the harpy eagle within Belize.',

        description: 'The Jabiru standing five feet tall with wings spanning nine feet, is the largest bird in Belize. Although its range extends from southeastern Mexico to northern Argentina, this native stork is now considered an endangered species. They are sometimes seen in roadside pools, but most reliably observed in the vicinity of the Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. Recent studies have confirmed that Belize has the healthiest breeding population of jabirus for all of Central America. They arrive in Belize from Mexico in November and nest in the tall pines of the savannas and marshes of the Belizean lowlands. They remain in Belize until June or July, flying north with the first rains.',

        description: 'The Scarlet Macaw is arguably the most magnificent bird of the parrot family. With their wide strong wings, macaws can reach speeds of 35 miles per hour. They often fly in pairs or small groups and often call to each other in raucous hoarse voices. Macaws appear to prefer higher elevations and riparian (riverine) forests. They are known to have very large territories. They prefer to nest in holes high up in trees and lay one or two eggs. They feed on specific fruits such as polewood, roaming large areas searching for clumps of their favorite foods.',

The most obvious characteristic of the toucan is the huge yellow, orange, red, green and black bill. The toucan’s bill is amazingly dextrous and allows the bird to feed on a variety of tropical forest fruits. The Keel-billed toucans are a very social bird and can often be seen in flocks of six or more birds. They are found throughout Belize’s forests and nest in holes in tree trunks.',
